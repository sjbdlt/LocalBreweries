# User Story

    I would like to have a page that shows me what breweries are near by
    I would like to be able to store some of the breweries for later reference
    I would like to have a sign in page so then i can see a private list of breweries i searched
    I would like a way to remove past searches or add additional breweries

# User Acceptance

    When a page display a list of breweries in an area
    When a site ask me to login 
    When i can save, update or remove breweries from a destination i looked up

## DESCRIPTION:

    We want to create a site that uses a API to lookup local breweries in the area that one can have a drink. We want the user to be able to login so they can save a list of breweries in a city they might want to visit. Then we want to be able to add or remove breweries from these lookup as the user decides too.
